*This is the first post of China tea sourcing story series which reveals the real man real tea real realtionship and how real really lucky to meet one excellent tea. Yes tea can be a commodity, what you need is just go to the auction room and raise your offer. Meanwhile *tea can be an art work*, this means it needs some inspiration and luck. Besides China is big and there are so many different tea in China, it makes tea sourcing kind of like explorer's work.*

It's night time, on the table, there are one Yixing teapot, one white ceramic Gaiwan and one cup, the kettle is boiling, before pouring I have a deep smell of tea. Wow so nice aroma, it is Dan Cong which I just found last week and finished roating yesterday. I am satisfied even not taste it yet.

This Duck Shit Dan Cong Oolong tea comes from Pinghe county, Zhangzhou city of Fujian Province. It's plucked on October 25, 2025.

**Why should I care about this tea?** There are so many Dan Cong out there even organic certified.

It is a very good question, we have many Dan Cong teas but this one gets me exciting, because it is wild. No pesticide, no fertilizer, no weeding, just let it go. It's overgrown with reed, rabits and other small animals are the citizen not humans. If you get in there, somewhat you will be threatened as the bird's nest is somewhere. This is the wild community of tea plants.
