## Why Spicy? ##

Firstly to clarify a possible misunderstanding, this tea is 100% natural, not scented with jinger or chilli, it's a pure loose leaf tea.

It's made with varietal of Yellow Dawn and Iron Godness of Mercy, floral, sweet and a slightly strong sense of irritation.

## A Result of 3 yrs of experiment ##

Oolong tea is a complex tea, we love it so much, so maybe to show out our love is to make an easy yet affordable tea.

We have good source of fresh leaves and first class roasting skill, so we decided to combine these together and made something nice happen.
