The genesis of all is a special tea travel in 2019, we two men drove a car all around the tea production area, we made some reviews on farmers, one very interesting idea we got is **quantity does matter quality**.

> Nowadays it is impossible to follow the same process as in the past because of the large quantity.

That's what we heard from a 83 years old tea man and similar saying from other farmers. No pay no get, that's quite reasonable, especially when dealing with food or tea.

To keep great, we choose to be small and try to get small tea farmers' tea appreciated by more people.

That's why we would love to help buyers purchase tea from farmers directly while ourself have a tea mountain and the most beautiful factory.

## How we help your buying from farmers more smoothly? ##

There are a lot of pains as a buyer make purchasing from farmers directly, the 4 biggest troubles needs to be resolved are language, payment, shipment and quality assurance.

### Language barrier ###
If you don't know their lanuguage you don't know what they are talking about, if you are not in tea, you don't know what their tea language is. We got both, we can translate and as we are pressional that we can do it right.

### Payment is all about pain ###
International money collecting normally is out of farmers' control, PayPal might be an answer but setting up the account then withdraw and exchange to Chinese currency, that's too complex. And all this lots of work sometimes doesn't worth if it's just for small money. We can do all these dirty work and pay farmers local currency on behalf of you.

### Shipping nightmare ###
There is one joke, "our customs is ok to let you in why China can not let it go? in order to protect the developped country? :-)"

It's a joke but it's true. International shipping is about lots of paper work and rules and costly if you are not professional.

Here with us, all you need to do is asking farmers send teas to our warehouse in China and waiting for its delivery, we will take care of all the middle stuffs.

### Will I get the quality promised? ###
It's reasonable to be doubtful, even kids might be tought not trust strangers, some people may heard somebody received a tea which is different from the sample. Don't worry, we will do the QC job, eliminate the danger in the origin.
