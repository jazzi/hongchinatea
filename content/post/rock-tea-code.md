If you are connected with Wuyi Rock tea you might hear the code 105 or 305 frequently, these are the local name of tea varietal derived from the Fujian Tea Research Institute. In the process of research, a lot of options there, so a number is offered for each of them and before official published, they offer these new varietals to Wuyi farmers to try and collect feedbacks. As no name yet so the code used instead, even after published for so many years, local farmers are still more familar with these code.

You might noticed many of them come from Tieguanyin and Huang Jin Gui which areh the two most famous teas in Anxi county.

In Wuyi 105 Huang Guanyin is very widely planted, it's a must have for blending Da Hong Pao.

Kind of strange in Anxi county almost no 105 could be found, instead lots of 
204 Jin Guanyin is planted.

Another varietal I love very much is varietal 203 Jin Mu Dan which has charming peach aroma, one more step, it can produce better Oriental Beauty than traditional Qing Xin Da Mao.

These varietals are so different and fascinating.
