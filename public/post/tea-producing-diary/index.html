<p>Annie and I set up an video meeting to talk about her China tea purchasing travel, this would be the first time to visit tea garden after her company found, the COVID-19 delays everything, thankfully it&rsquo;s over now, everyone can in and out of China freely.</p>
<p>We talk about what regions and farmers she wanna visit, wow that&rsquo;s a long list, I can see how exciting it is. Unfortunately April is a very busy month to me, gotta to make new teas, luckily my friend Lily in Hangzhou can lend me a hand, so I will go with her to Guangdong and Fujian then let pass the job to Lily.</p>
<p>I asked a question, &ldquo;what tea is you want mostly?&rdquo; Annie didn&rsquo;t answer me directly instead she told me a story that everytime a customer want to buy White Jade, she will say &ldquo;no no no, you should try Raw Jade, it&rsquo;s produced by a remarkable woman&rdquo;, and then tell the story of how the woman fight with the life from ground and make beauty happen. This woman is Ms. Jade.</p>
<p>Annie wants to help this woman and promote more her teas but becasue of the weather and her organic farming method, there is no big chance to get hight quality tea every year. It&rsquo;s like a gambling, we both don&rsquo;t like it, besides it&rsquo;s a big loss to Ms. Jade, this kind of helplessness sucks.</p>
