<p>&ldquo;I had a fabulous experience in Fujian Province with my Tea Tour arranged by World Tea Tours and guided in Xiamen by Daniel Hong.  We visited Anxi County and were received warmly by local tea producers. I don&rsquo;t think we could ever hope to have such unique and valuable tea experiences as we had with Daniel guiding us. &quot;</p>

<p>Last week David took a one-day Anxi Tie Guan Yin tea tour, as he didn&rsquo;t have much time, so we lived in the farmer&rsquo;s nice wood carving house, cupping tons of teas, &ldquo;horse riding&rdquo; to the wild tea farm, talked to the mother bush, visited the neighbors and tasted their awarded teas, not stranger at all ^_^</p>
<p>Everything is exciting yet peaceful, here we are son of the nature, it&rsquo;s not just because of what we learned, it&rsquo;s also about the smiles on people&rsquo;s face and the shining stars, all this <em>real things</em> stop our daily racing life, a break, a blank. <strong>When we are not full, the world can&rsquo;t fool us</strong>.</p>
